<h1>About Me</h1>

  Hi, I'm Cigdem Korkmaz, a Junior Full-Stack Developer passionate about
  building modern, responsive, and efficient web applications. I specialize in

  With a strong focus on both front-end and back-end development, I enjoy
  creating seamless user experiences while ensuring robust functionality behind
  the scenes. Whether it's designing interactive UIs with React, developing APIs
  with Node.js, or working with databases, I'm always eager to learn and improve
  my craft.

  Beyond coding, I enjoy watching films, trying delicious food, traveling to new
  places, and taking long walks. I'm always open to exciting projects and
  collaborationsâ€”let's build something amazing together!
